I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at the University of Warwick supervised by [Prof. Peter Triantafillou](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/peter_triantafillou/). My current research is in the area of machine unlearning.


I received my master's degree in Control Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/cshen/home), [Prof. Meng Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/mengzhang2009) and [Prof. Xiaohong Guan](https://ieeecss.org/contact/xiaohong-guan). I also hold a dipl√¥me d‚Äôing√©nieur from [√âcole Centrale de Lille](https://centralelille.fr/en/) in France.


More info about my background can be found in my [CV](../assets/CV-Kairan Zhao.pdf).

## Research Interests

<!-- ====== -->

My research interests lie in machine unlearning, privacy, security and where these fields connect.
I'm particularly interested in understanding how memorization, generalization, and representation in neural networks impact both learning and unlearning processes.
